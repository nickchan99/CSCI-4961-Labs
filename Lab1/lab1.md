### Open Source Definition

From the definition of open source, I understand the primary goal of keeping open source code available to the public at no cost. I feel that the line: 

> Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed.

to be very open for interpretation. Can some strange pythonic techniques qualify as "deliberately obfuscated" in the eyes of some developers? Additionally, the use of open source code in derived products is somewhat of a gray area to me. I know closed source products like Instagram list all of the open source, yet I am unsure how licensing of Instagram must interact with the licenses of the libraries it uses. I also find it interesting that the OSD includes provisions preventing discrimination of all types. I am curious about the concequences for derived works that violate these principles. 

### Eric Raymond's "Smart Questions"

I have to wholehartedly agree with the idea of doing some legwork before asking a question. Personally, I feel that whenever I had an issue, trying to fix it is far more fruitful than asking for a spoon-fed answer that I may not understand anyway. I think that the idea that an answer must be earned is very interesting. In face to face conversation, it may be rude to not answer a question that is asked (depending on the context.) Carrying this expectation into the online world seems unrealistic in this respect. People don't always have time to answer questions that do not directly effect them, so it is inherently similar to earning a favor from someone. Setting up the question so that it is easy to answer seems to tap into the instant nature of the internet. After reading this article, I feel that I have asked some loser tier questions, but they have not been online. I think that loser questions like "what is X" or "what is the best way to get started with Y" that I've asked have been to instructors or people that I am close with, and I generally do not expect extremely formal answers. Usually a tip in the right direction is fine for me.

From past experience, a helpful way to answer questions is to give clear examples. When asked a question about code, I usually try to give a use case, or an expected result for a function call with certain arguments. 

Another helpful techniuqe for answering questions is to draw diagrams or picutres. I find myself to be a visual learner, so when I come across other visual learners that need help with something, drawing a diagram will be easiest for them to learn from.

### Chapter 3 of Free Culture: Catalogs

From reading this chapter, it appears that the RIAA sued the creator of a tool for solving a problem that the creator had not considered. In Tuesday's lecture, it was mentioned that a great tool has many more uses than what it was designed for. In the case of Jesse Jordan, he came up with a very powerful Intranet search engine, but the end users had used it to store music files in a public folder on the network. The people that used the tool for this wanted to circumvent any kind of payment for music, so they shared and downloaded files from this server. It could be possilbe that they felt the rest of the internet could not access the folder on RPI's network, so they went through with it. I find it bizarre that the application of a filesystem included in Windows to simply check and see if a network computer was online resulted in a piracy lawsuit. The RIAA would have had valid grounds to sue on if Jesse had explicitly set up the network to share music. If he did not, then the suit was seemingly pointless in terms of punishing someone for wrongdoing. Additionally, I feel that entities like the RIAA that lobby are the scourge of democratic government, but that is a topic for another time. The unfortunate targeting of Jesse by the RIAA is concerning, especially today. Tons and tons of open source projects exist on the web. The idea that an established corporation can sue a volounteer for what users do with that person's project is a failure of the legal system.
