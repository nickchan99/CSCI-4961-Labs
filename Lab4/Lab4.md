<!--- Adding a Creative Commons license is not available using Github's license template options (https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/33), so I used the Unilicense for the time being. -->

The four principles of free software are:  
Freedom 0: The freedom to run software as the user wishes for any purpose.  
Freedom 1: The freedom to study and alter the functionality of a program to fit the users needs. This implies that the source code is open.  
Freedom 2: The source code may be redistributed with the goal of helping others.  
Freedom 3: The changes a user makes to a program may be redistributed, so that the community may benefit.

Choosing a license is important since many different kinds of licenses exist, and guaranteeing users certain freedoms is important on
a project by project basis. Without a license, users may use your project in unintended ways or manupilate the project maliciously and cite
your source code. Additionally, the future marketability of a project is affected by what license the project uses. Lack of a license implies
that all rights are reserved, so people can avoid using your repository in fear of violating copyright law. Picking the right licnese also
reserves certain rights to you, as the copyright holder.

Using a project without a license is basically using someone else's private works. A project without a license insn't open source, the code
is a product of someone's effort and they may have intentionally left out a license to deter others from using it for the time being. In the
case of GitHub, publishing a public repo entitles users to the ability to view and fork a repository, so that would be the only thing that
can be done without violating copyright law.

I agree with the author's point. The closed development of Gopher's protocols means that the engineers designed them without consulting any
other people in the field. This means that they may have missed use cases, or missed out on a good idea that could have imrpoved their design.
The web's end goal was to connect computers across the world, so it made sense to develop their system as open, leading to extensibility of HTTP,
which also allowed the Web to outpace Gopher. As more people start to use a technology, the ones that aren't as thoroughly run usually get left
behind in terms of comopatibility and developer count, so its clear that this is why the Web was superior in the end.

The Linux kernel uses GNU's GPL v2.0 license to encourage others to download and use it. It has warranty guarantees, and explicitly grants
the users the right to download, use, and modify it. This leads to improvement upon the kernel from many developers, and bug reports from
many users since the software costs nothing to download (depending on the Linux flavor.) It prevents sublicensing to keep people from making
changes and restricting the use of the modified version. Additionally, the license enables commercial use to potentially disrupt Microsoft's
market share in the operating systems market.
